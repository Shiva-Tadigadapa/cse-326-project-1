        <p>Home practice is hard. It’s only human to go through phases where you get distracted by the shiny new
            challenge pose to try—or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, simply getting stuck in your favorite
            feel-good sequence. While you definitely don’t want to lose sight of goals or the sweet sensations that keep
            you coming back to your mat, it’s a good idea to take a critical eye to your practice now and then and look
            for the areas where you could strive for greater balance.</p>

        <p>That’s what yoga is all about after all, and practitioners of every level can benefit from going back to
            basics regularly to reexamine the actions and alignment of foundational standing poses, backbends, forward
            bends, and inversions. So, I’ve compiled a list of poses that really stand the test of time—that is, 10
            asanas every single yogi should be practicing on the regular. Here’s what made my list, along with focus
            tips for beginner, intermediate, and advanced practitioners.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="first-sec intro-head">
        <h2>(1) Malasana (Garland Pose)</h2>
        <p>
            This beautiful squat is one of my all-time favorite poses. Malasana releases the lower back, opens the hips,
            and turns the practitioner into a cute little nugget. Explore variations and tips on how to make this pose
            easier or how to go deeper.
        </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                It’s common for beginners to struggle with dropping their heels to the ground. Make sure to spin your
                heels in and toes out, as well as to widen your stance. If it irritates your knees to drop into a full
                squat, sit on one or more blocks.
            </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                Step up the hip-opening element of this pose by incorporating your arms. Lean forward to wiggle your
                upper arms to the inside of your legs. Draw your palms together in front of your heart and push your
                heart into your thumbs. This will naturally encourage external rotation and give you that extra ahhhh
                moment.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                Full Malasana is traditionally performed with the feet together, knees wide, and the torso in a forward
                fold with either the arms extending or wrapped behind the heels. You typically see this pose done with
                feet wider than the hips (which is still my personal favorite to release my back and hips after a long
                day).

    <div class="second-sec intro-head">
        <h2>(2) Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose)</h2>
        <p>
            Chaturanga is one of the most common postures in Vinyasa yoga—but also one of the most abused. Students tend
            to rush this pose, cheating its alignment, which with repetition can lead to injury. Check out my pointers
            below to revisit this foundational posture and begin treating it as its own pose instead of a transition.
        </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                Many people don’t have the strength and/or body awareness to perform this posture with good alignment. I
                recommend most students learn this pose with their knees down. Focus on drawing the lower belly up to
                prevent dumping in the lower back.
            </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                Have the eye of the tiger! Gaze forward the entire time to prevent rounding in the upper back (we always
                want to look down here, look forward!) Draw the shoulder heads back and focus on extending your heart as
                you lower so the elbows stay over the wrists instead of falling behind the heels of your hands.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                Use full breath! People love to fly through this pose. Take a full inhale in Plank and a full exhale to
                come into Chaturanga. Don’t transition out of it until your exhale is complete. This takes control,
                awareness, and prevents you from making silly mistakes and moving too quickly.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="third-sec intro-head">
        <h2>(3) Crescent Lunge</h2>
        <p>
            I can’t imagine a yoga practice without this perfect standing pose. Crescent Lunge my go-to for opening my
            hips and psoas, encouraging space in my chest, and feeling powerful on my feet.
        </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                You’ll see newer students struggling for balance in this pose. Easy fix. Look down. Odds are your feet
                are too narrow. Make sure your front and back foot are hip-width apart. This will widen the stance and
                allow you to balance.
            </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                There’s a tendency to lean forward in this pose which is often caused by pitching in your lower back or
                tightness in the psoas connected to your back leg. Bend your back knee as much as you need to for
                mobility in your pelvis. Draw the front crest of your pelvis up to neutral (like a bowl full of kombucha
                that you don’t want to spill) and gently draw your back leg toward straight.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                Try adding the element of a backbend/dropback in your upper body. Follow the rules you’ve read so far
                and then reach your arms overhead interlacing all the fingers except for your thumb and index. Keep the
                base of the neck relaxed as you lift your heart up and curl your upper chest. Draw an imaginary line
                along the ceiling going up and back. </p>

    <div class="fourth-sec intro-head">
        <h2>(4) Utthita Trikonasana</h2>
        <p>
            Trikonasana. Such a classic standing pose! We live in a world where standing poses are often ignored, but
            this one is part of my regular practice come rain or shine. It is a glorious way to release your lower back,
            strengthen your core, and expand your body (and mind). </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                Students tend to collapse their lower body trying to get their hand or palm to the ground. Skip that
                step and place your palm either on a block outside of your shin or on your shin below your knee. This
                enables you to even out through both sides of your ribcage creating even length in the trunk of your
                body. </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                It’s so easy to get sassy in this pose! Most people stick out their butts (pitch in their lower backs)
                and puff their ribs. Focus on corseting your ribcage in (wrapping the bones towards your midline) and
                keeping your lower belly engaged and lifted to create space in your lower back. </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                The final step is taking both of these tips and looking down. You want to line your torso up with your
                front leg (most students lean toward the inside). Can you keep both sides of your waist even, ribs in,
                belly engaged and lower back long as you lean back? Of course, you can! Practice, practice, practice.
            </p>

        <h2>(5) Parivrtta Utkatasana</h2>
        <p>
            I know Chair Pose isn’t the most popular pose in the world, but this is why it’s on the list. It’s a great
            foundational pose to teach us how to twist safely. If you can learn the mechanics of a twist here, you’ll be
            safer in more advanced postures. </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                Look at your knees! You want to keep your lower back even, and the best clue comes from your knees. You
                want them to stay even, so if you have one popping out, draw it back in! This will neutralize your lower
                back and keep you safe. </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                Draw your palms into Anjali Mudra and press them into each other. Press so much that your torso revolves
                and your heart lifts up to meet your thumbs. That’s a juicy twist! </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                Reach your bottom hand down to the outside of your foot and extend the top arm back up. Combine the work
                of keeping your knees/hips level and using your outer arm to push into your leg to get the beautiful
                turn in your chest. </p>

    <div class="sixth-sec intro-head">
        <h2>(6) Salamba Sirsasana (Supported Headstand)</h2>
        <p>
            Inversions are a magical group of postures that reverses our perspective and give us a strong dose of
            empowerment. Tripod Headstand is one of the easier inversions to balance because of the large foundation.
            It’s also fantastic to understand if you want to move into advanced transitions such as lowering into arm
            balances. </p>
        <div class="ol-list-sec-all-2">
            <h3>Beginner</h3>
            <p>
                Place the crown of your head on the ground with your hands shoulder-width apart and elbows stacking over
                the heels of your hands. Curl your toes under and straighten your legs to enter a Dolphin Pose. Focus on
                keeping the elbows in (engage your adductors) and draw your shoulders up away from the ground to prevent
                collapsing into your neck. </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                Keep the same actions as above, but as you gain flexibility, walk your feet in enough so you can place
                one knee at a time onto the back of your arms (aim closer to the armpits if possible). Again, keep the
                elbows in and shoulders up to prevent collapsing your arms from the weight of your legs. </p>
            <h3>Advanced</h3>
            <p>
                From the knee position draw them up off of your arms and into your chest like a cannon ball. Continue to
                draw the legs up until they straighten out keeping the legs hugging into the midline the entire time.
                You can also enter this posture from Dolphin walking your feet in, keeping the legs straight, and
                entering from a press. </p>

        <h2>(7) Viparita Karani (Legs-up-the-Wall Pose)</h2>
        <p>
            This is such a glorious pose and great for all levels of students! Leg-Up-the-Wall Pose is the best way to
            relax after a long day or practice on your feet. It drains the legs and is also a fantastic posture if you
            struggle with insomnia.

                Place a folded blanket or bolster lengthwise along the wall. Sit on it sideways with one hip touching
                the wall. As you lie down, swivel around and sweep your legs up the wall, keeping your lower back
                elevated. </p>
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p>
                Lose the blanket or bolster, and just practice Legs-Up-the-Wall with your hips flush against the

                Make a lasso out of a strap and tighten it around the balls of both of your feet. Bring your legs up the

                the loop around your feet and two loops around your shins to tighten everything together. Let your legs
                fully relax. </p>
